# EspnRb

A ruby wrapper for the ESPN api.  It allows you to interact, in a semantically pleasing way, with the ESPN api.  Currently it only allows access to the publicly available Headline API which can be found [here](http://developer.espn.com/docs/headlines).  I am working to bring more of ESPN's features to espn_rb.  While I do that I'll try to keep this document updated to its current functionality.  That said, I hope you enjoy. 

## Installation

### As of Version 0.0.4

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
    
    gem "espn_rb", "~> 0.0.4"
    
In order to use espn_rb you need to first get an API key from ESPN [ESPN api request](http://developer.espn.com/member/register).  Once you've gotten that squared away you can use the public requests straight away.  


## Set your API key

The easiest way to set your api key for use with espn_rb is to export it as an environment variable. Do that like so:

```sh
 $ export espn_api_key=YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_API_KEY 
```

If you want to pass it in to your objects you may do so explicitly like so:

```ruby
  espn = EspnRb.headlines(:api_key => YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_API_KEY)
```

For the sake of simplicity all my examples will assume that you have exported the API key as an environment variable. 

## Espn Headines

Instantiate the EspnRb object and check the headlines.

#### Get all headlines

```ruby
require 'espn_rb'
espn = Espn.headlines

espn.all
#=> HeadlineResponse
```

Which will return an HeadlineResponse object.

#### Get ESPN response as JSON

To get the response straight from the horses' mouth:

```ruby
# from above
  
espn.all.response
#=> ESPN's response string as JSON
```

The raw response from ESPN will give you the top ten stories meeting your criteria.  

### HeadlineResponse

Now includes Enumerable which allows you to treat the HeadlineResponse as an iterable object.  

```ruby
espn = EspnRb.headlines
espn.all.each do |headline_item| 
  puts "----- Headline: #{headline_item.title}----\n"
  puts headline_item.athletes
  puts "\n-----------------------------------\n\n"
end

# ----- Headline: Warriors-Clippers Preview----
# NBA
# Chris Paul
# Los Angeles Clippers
# Golden State Warriors
# Blake Griffin
# Mo Williams
# David Lee
# Stephen Curry
# 
# -----------------------------------
# 
# ----- Headline: Red Sox 5, Rays 0----
# MLB
# Daniel Bard
# Boston Red Sox
# Tampa Bay Rays
# Alfredo Aceves
# Jose Iglesias
# Wade Davis
# Jeff Keppinger
# Elliot Johnson
# Evan Longoria
# Matt Moore
# Luke Scott
# David Price
# 
# -----------------------------------
```

#### Collections

Since the above response is a basic collection and each headline share many common attributes there are collection methods defined on the HeadlineResponse object.  Use them like so.

```ruby
# from above

# Available methods are [headlines descriptions sources bylines types]

espn.all.response.titles 
#=> ["array", "of", "ESPN", "titles"]
    
espn.all.response.descriptions
#=> ["array", "of", "ESPN", "descriptions"]

# etc...
```

#### API methods

When calling on the api to get new data you can pass any (soon) of the methods supported by the API.

```ruby
espn = EspnRb.headlines

espn.nba(:news) #=> HeadlineResponse
espn.nba(:top)  #=> HeadlineResponse
espn.nba({:for_date => "2012-03-09"}) #=> HeadlineResponse # Will include all stories for that date
espn.nba({:for_athlete => "1234" #=> HeadlineResponse # Will include all stories for that athleteId

```

### HeadlineItem

The HeadlineResponse Object holdes in it the headlines split into HeadlineItems.  Here is where you can get Specific information about each story.  Some of the options are:

```ruby
espn = EspnRb.headlines
headline_response = espn.nba[2] #=> HeadlineItem

headline_response.web_url #=> "http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=nba&id=7664408&ex_cid=espnapi_public"
headline_response.id #=> 7664408
headline_response.title #=> "Mavericks-Kings Preview"
headline_response.athletes #=> ["Johnny B", "Freddie Flintstone", "Etc"]
headline_response.leagues #=> ["46"]
headline_response.athlete_ids #=> ["123", "132", "123"]

# More to come in future versions.
headline_response.headline #=> JSON hash from original response.
```

espn = Espn.headlines
espn.help
